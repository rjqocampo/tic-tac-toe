### Built With
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* Other tools used:
  
  * Github Pages for free hosting
  * Git for version control
  * Figma for mockup
  * Chrome DevTools for debugging
  * Visual Studio Code for IDE

### Motivation
To practice and refine my Javascript and CSS fundamentals

### My Learnings
* Value of destructuring assignment syntax
* Value of Chrome DevTools, specifically the Breakpoints and Watch feature
* Value of not polluting the global namespace
* Value of SASS mixins and nesting for cleaner CSS
* Importance of Javascript fundamentals
* Importance of animations to give user feedback
* Importance of making functions small and modular for code reusabality and maintainability
* Usefulness of event delegation in handling multiple listeners
* Usefulness of design patterns to help organize code
* Strengths of the Revealing Module Pattern in encapsulating and securing code via scopes and closures

### Known Issues
* AI logic is random

### Prospective Updates
* Better algorithm for AI logic
* Add animation when there's a 3-in-a-row grid instead of just post-round dialog pop-up for better UX

# Usage

### Game Rules

The rules of the Tic-Tac-Toe game are the same as always. 

* The game is played on a 3x3 grid
* Two players take turns to mark their symbols (X and O) on empty grids
* The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins
* If all grids are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw

### How-to

1. Choose your mark.

2. Choose which game mode to play: VS AI or VS PLAYER.

3. Click the empty grid where you want to place your mark.

4. The first to get 3-in-a-row wins the round. You can choose to play again after.
